Linker:-

In computer science, a linker or link editor is a computer program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable program.



NASM principally outputs object files, which are generally not executable in and of themselves. 
The only exception to this are flat binaries (e.g., .COM) which are inherently limited in modern use. 
To translate the object files into executable programs, an appropriate linker must be used, such as the Visual Studio "LINK" utility for Windows or ld for UNIX-like systems.
